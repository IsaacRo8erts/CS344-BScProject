# CS344-ThirdYearProject

For my third year dissertation project I performed machine learning techniques on NBA data to compare different eras of basketball, more specifically, what statistics led to games being won. To view and analyse our results different visualisation techniques were used.

Data:

This project involved manipulating raw data to create vast datasets that could be analysed. Extra columns were added manually such as team wins and losses, as well as games played.

The machine learning techniques used were the following:

  - Permutation importance: Used to discover what statistics contribute most to the winning of an NBA game.
  
  - Random Forest: Used to create a model that would be fed to our permutation function.

The visualisation techniques used were the following:

  - Correlation Matrix: Used to discover how 3-point percentage impacts the winning of a game in different eras. 
  
  - Scatter Matrix with Line of Best Fit: Used to analyse individual team's 3-point percentage and the impact it has on winning. Line of best fit used to display clear correlations.
  
  - Stacked Histogram: Used interactively with scatter graph for better viewing functionality when selecting specific teams.
